His life was marked by a distinguished career in politics and economics, leaving a significant impact on the nation.  From his early life in Gatuyaini village to his education at Makerere University and the London School of Economics, Kibaki demonstrated a commitment to learning and a passion for public service.</p>
            <p>His political journey began in the early 1960s, playing a crucial role in drafting Kenya's independence constitution.  He served in various ministerial positions, including Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, before becoming Vice President under President Daniel arap Moi.  After a period in opposition, Kibaki achieved a landslide victory in the 2002 presidential elections, ending decades of KANU rule.</p>

He oversaw the implementation of Vision 2030, a long-term development plan aimed at transforming Kenya into a middle-income country.  Despite facing challenges such as the 2007-2008 post-election violence, Kibaki's leadership played a key role in Kenya's progress.</p>
